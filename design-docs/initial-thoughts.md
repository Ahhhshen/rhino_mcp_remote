Connecting Reer's web application backend to a remote MCP server (like one hosted on Cloudflare), which in turn needs to communicate bidirectionally with *multiple users' individual local* CAD instances (via your `rhino_mcp` plugin), requires careful design.

To identify the core difficulty: the remote server needs to manage connections *to* potentially firewalled local machines. Direct inbound connections from the remote server to the local Rhino plugin's WebSocket server are generally impractical due to NAT and firewalls.

Here’s a breakdown of the most viable approach and how to think about the user experience and technical implementation:

**1. Core Architecture: Local Plugin Initiates Outbound Connection**

The standard and most reliable way to handle this is for the connection to be initiated *from* the local environment *to* the remote server.

*   **Rhino Plugin (`rhino_mcp` plugin):** The plugin installed in the user's local Rhino instance should act as a WebSocket *client*.
*   **Remote MCP Server (Cloudflare/Custom):** This server needs to expose a WebSocket endpoint specifically for these incoming connections from the Rhino plugins. It will manage multiple persistent WebSocket connections, one for each active user's Rhino instance.
*   **Web App Backend:** The backend acts as an MCP client, sending requests to the *MCP endpoint* (likely SSE) of the remote server. These requests must include a way to identify the target user (e.g., a User ID).
*   **Remote MCP Server (The Bridge):** This server now has two roles:
    *   It receives MCP requests from your  backend (identifying the user).
    *   It looks up the corresponding active WebSocket connection for that specific user's Rhino plugin.
    *   It forwards the command over that specific WebSocket connection to the local Rhino plugin.
    *   It receives responses/updates back from the Rhino plugin via the WebSocket and forwards them back to the appropriate  backend client (likely via the MCP connection).

**2. User Experience for Setup and Connection**

Since the connection originates locally, the user needs to perform a one-time setup:

*   **Plugin Installation:** The user installs the `rhino_mcp` plugin into their Rhino application. Now it's only the rhino_script.py, which later should be turned into a Rhino plugin.
*   **Configuration within Rhino:**
    *   The web application needs to provide each authenticated user with unique connection details for their plugin. This would typically include:
        *   The specific WebSocket URL of the remote MCP server dedicated to plugin connections.
        *   A unique authentication token or API key for that user to securely identify their plugin's connection to the remote server.
    *   The Rhino plugin needs a settings interface where the user can input this URL and token.
*   **Initiating Connection:** The plugin, upon starting (e.g., via a Rhino command like `mcpstart`), uses the configured URL and token to establish the persistent WebSocket connection *outbound* to the remote server.
*   **Web Application Feedback:** The web app UI should provide clear feedback to the user:
    *   Instructions on how to install and configure the plugin.
    *   Displaying their unique connection URL/token.
    *   A status indicator showing whether their local Rhino plugin is currently connected to the remote server.

**3. Technical Implementation (Remote Server)**

This is where the main challenge lies – managing potentially many persistent WebSocket connections and mapping them correctly.

*   **Technology Choice for Remote Server:**
    *   **Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects:** This should be an excellent fit. Could potentially create a Durable Object instance per connected user/plugin. The Durable Object would:
        *   Accept and manage the persistent WebSocket connection from that user's specific Rhino plugin.
        *   Store the WebSocket connection state, potentially hibernating when idle to save costs.
        *   Receive forwarded MCP requests (originally from , routed by a front-end Worker based on User ID/token) intended for that user.
        *   Send the command over the stored WebSocket connection to the local Rhino plugin.
        *   Receive responses from the plugin via the WebSocket and push them back (via the MCP server mechanism) to the application's backend.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Plugin Connection:** The WebSocket connection from the Rhino plugin *must* be authenticated (e.g., using the unique token provided) so the remote server knows which user it belongs to and can store the mapping correctly.
    *   **MCP Requests:** Requests from ther host app's backend to the remote MCP server also need authentication to identify the originating user and ensure they are authorized. 
*   **Bidirectional Flow:** WebSockets are inherently bidirectional. The remote server listens for messages coming *from* the Rhino plugin (e.g., command results, status updates) and needs logic to route these back to the correct  backend instance associated with that user.
